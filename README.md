# Recipe Bot

There's a bot for everything, and this is a bot to easily find new recipes. It was build by making use of the [Serverless Framework CLI](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/). Why? Just for fun ðŸ˜‰

## How does it works?

1. Start a conversation with the bot with a `/start` command/message. 
2. Send a message like `/recipe [ingredient1, ingredient2, ...]`.

## Do you wanna try it?

The main thing you will require is a Telegram Bot Token. Once you have that and with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, build the image:

`docker build --rm -f "Dockerfile" -t recipebot:latest "."`

And run the Serverless Server ðŸ˜Ž:

`docker run -e TELEGRAM_TOKEN=<YOUR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN> -it --rm -p 80:80 recipebot`

Now you only need to use some tunneling tool like [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and set the url as a webhook to Telegram making a request to this URL:

`https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN_BOT>/setWebhook?url=<TUNNELING_URL>/find`
